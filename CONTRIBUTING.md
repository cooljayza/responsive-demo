Eblocks contributing guidelines.
​
## Commit Message Guidelines
​
### Introduction
​
We follow the Angular Commit Message guildelines, which can be found here:
​
[https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines)
​
We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to **more readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**. But also, we use the git commit messages to  **auto-generate the change log**.
​
### Commit Message Format
​
Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**. The header has a special format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:
​
    <type>(<scope>): <subject>
    <BLANK LINE>
    <body>
    <BLANK LINE>
    <footer>
​
The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.
​
Any line of the commit message should not be longer than 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on Bitbucket as well as in various git tools.
​
Samples:
​
    docs(changelog): update changelog to beta.5
​
    fix(release): need to depend on latest rxjs and zone.js
​
    The version in our package.json gets copied to the one we publish, and users need the latest of these.
​
#### Revert
​
If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:` , followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.
​
#### Type
​
Must be one of the following:
​
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: webpack, npm)
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
​
#### Scope
​
The scope should be the name of the feature or package you that the change touches. If it multiple words, it should be camelCased.
​
For example:
​
- navbar
- adminPortal
​
#### Subject
​
The subject contains a succinct description of the change:
​
- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no dot (.) at the end
​
#### Body
​
Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes". The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
​
#### Footer
​
The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to optionally reference Jira issues that this commit **Closes**.
​
#### Breaking Changes
​
Should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

## Pull Request Process
​
At Eblocks we make use of a git workflow called Git Flow.
​
You can find a fantastic breakdown by Atlassian below
​
[Gitflow Workflow | Atlassian Git Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
​
We typically always have three environments, DEV, UAT and PROD
​
Where,
​
- DEV = Development
- UAT = User Acceptance Testing (Quality Assurance, QA)
- PROD = Production (Live)
​
As a result, we setup up repositories to follow the same pattern. There are three primary branches:
​
- develop
- uat
- prod
​
Clearly seen, each branch maps to an environment. Code is never directly pushed to each of the branches, a PR is always raised, reviewed and then merged into the respective branch.
​
### Pull Request Workflow
​
Refer to the Giflow specification for a detailed description of Gitflow.
The most common (daily) development workflow would encompass the following steps:
​
##### 1. Create a branch off of `develop`
​
Name the branch with your first `feature` pre-pended:
`feature/cool-feature`
​
The branch name should describe the feature you're working on. Either delimited with a dash (`-`) or underscore (`_`);
​
- `feature/cool-new-feature`
- `feature/update_main_header`
​
##### 2. Writing code
​
Write your code in your new branch.
​
##### 3. Commit your changes
​
Commit frequently, while adhering to Eblocks's standard [commit message guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines)
​
##### 4. Create a pull request on Bitbucket
​
Include the Jira ticket number (if applicable) in either the PR title or description body
​
##### 5. Submit for review
​
- Assign the PR to the appropriate reviewer, often default reviewers are set.
​
##### 6. Merge changes
​
Once at least one approval has been made (project dependant), the changes can then be merged into the destination branch. The PR opener is responsible for merging their PR.
​
### Pull Request Template
​
The following template should be used as the default PR template.
